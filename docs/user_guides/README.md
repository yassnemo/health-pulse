## Patient Monitoring

### Patient List View

The patient list provides a sortable, filterable view of all patients:

1. Click "Patients" in the navigation menu
2. Use filters to narrow down the list:
   - Department/Ward
   - Risk level (High, Medium, Low)
   - Admission date
   - Attending physician
3. Click on any patient to view their detailed profile

### Patient Detail View

The patient detail page provides comprehensive information including:

- Patient demographics and admission details
- Current vital signs with trend indicators
- Risk scores with historical trends
- Recent alerts and notifications
- Clinical notes and observations
- Treatment timeline

## Risk Assessment

### Understanding Risk Scores

HealthPulse Analytics provides three key risk assessments:

1. **Deterioration Risk**: Likelihood of clinical deterioration in next 24 hours
2. **Readmission Risk**: For discharged patients, probability of 30-day readmission
3. **Sepsis Risk**: Probability of developing sepsis based on current clinical indicators

Risk scores range from 0.0 (lowest risk) to 1.0 (highest risk), with color coding:
- Green (0.0-0.39): Low risk
- Yellow (0.4-0.69): Medium risk
- Red (0.7-1.0): High risk

### Risk Explanation

To understand the factors contributing to a risk score:

1. Click on any risk score in the patient view
2. The "Risk Explanation" panel will display:
   - Key contributing factors ranked by importance
   - Comparison to normal ranges
   - Trend information (improving/worsening)
   - Similar patient cases and outcomes
   - Suggested clinical considerations

### Risk History

To view how a patient's risk has changed over time:

1. From the patient detail view, click "Risk History"
2. Select the risk type (deterioration, readmission, sepsis)
3. Choose a time range
4. The system will display a graph of risk scores over time
5. Hover over any point to see specific values and contributing factors at that time

## Alerts and Notifications

### Alert Types

The system generates several types of alerts:

- **Risk Threshold Alerts**: When a patient's risk score exceeds configured thresholds
- **Vital Sign Alerts**: When vital signs move outside normal ranges
- **Trend Alerts**: When a significant negative trend is detected
- **System Alerts**: Administrative notifications about the platform

### Managing Alerts

When you receive an alert:

1. Click on the alert to view details
2. Review the patient information and recommended actions
3. Choose an action:
   - **Acknowledge**: Indicates you've seen the alert
   - **Dismiss**: Mark as not requiring action (requires reason)
   - **Escalate**: Forward to another clinician or team
   - **Add Note**: Attach a clinical observation or action taken

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often is patient data updated?**

A: HealthPulse Analytics processes data in real-time. Vital signs and lab results appear as soon as they are recorded in the hospital's systems. Risk scores are recalculated every 15 minutes or immediately when new significant data is received.

**Q: What data is used to calculate risk scores?**

A: The system uses a combination of vital signs, lab results, medications, demographics, diagnosis codes, and historical patterns. The exact features depend on the risk model but typically include 40+ clinical variables.

**Q: How accurate are the risk predictions?**

A: The models undergo continuous validation. Current performance metrics:
- Deterioration prediction: 85% sensitivity, 82% specificity (AUROC 0.91)
- Readmission prediction: 78% sensitivity, 80% specificity (AUROC 0.85)
- Sepsis prediction: 83% sensitivity, 85% specificity (AUROC 0.89)

Performance statistics are updated monthly and available in the Admin > Model Performance section.

**Q: Can I see why a particular risk score was generated?**

A: Yes, the system provides full transparency. Click on any risk score to see the "Risk Explanation" panel showing contributing factors and their relative importance.

**Q: Is the system replacing clinical judgment?**

A: No. HealthPulse Analytics is a decision support tool that provides additional insights based on data analysis. Clinical judgment remains paramount, and the system is designed to augment rather than replace clinician expertise.

**Q: How do I report an issue with the system?**

A: Click the "Help" icon in the bottom right corner, then select "Report Issue." Provide details about the problem, and the support team will respond accordingly.
