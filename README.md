# HealthPulse Analytics

A comprehensive healthcare analytics platform using real-time predictive modeling to assess patient risks and provide actionable clinical insights.

## Project Overview

HealthPulse Analytics is a production-ready platform that predicts patient health risks in real-time, including readmissions, deterioration, and sepsis. The system provides clinicians with actionable insights through an interactive dashboard, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Continuous monitoring and prediction of patient health risks
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Intuitive visualization of patient data and risk scores
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Actionable insights for healthcare providers
- **Model Explainability**: Transparent AI with feature importance visualization
- **Secure & Compliant**: Built with healthcare security and privacy requirements in mind

## System Architecture

HealthPulse Analytics uses a modular microservices architecture with distinct components for:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
2. **Data Storage**: Snowflake/PostgreSQL for structured data storage
3. **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines for data transformation and validation
4. **ML Models**: Prediction engines for patient risk assessment
5. **API Gateway**: Secure endpoint for frontend communication
6. **Frontend**: React-based interactive dashboard for clinicians
